    <h1>Inch Time Foot Gem</h1>
    <p>A lord asked Takuan, a Zen teacher to suggest how he might pass the time. He felt his day very long attending his office and sitting stiffly to receive the homage of others.</p>
    <p>Takuan wrote eight Chinese characters and gave them to the man:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Not twice this day<br />
      Inch time foot gem<br />
      This day will not come again.<br />
      Each minute is worth a priceless gem.</p>

    <h1>True Reformation</h1>
    <p>Ryokan devoted his life to the study of Zen. One day he heard that his nephew, despite the admonitions of relatives, was spending his money on a courtesan. Inasmuch as the nephew had taken Ryokan&#8217;s place in managing the family estate and the property was in danger of being dissipated, the relatives asked Ryokan to do something about it.</p>
    <p>Ryokan had to travel a long way to visit his nephew, whom he had not seen for many years. The nephew seemed pleased to meet his uncle again and invited him to remain overnight.</p>
    <p>All night Ryokan sat in meditation. As he was departing in the morning he said to the young man: &#8220;I must be getting old, my hand shakes so. Will you help me tie the string of my straw sandal?&#8221;</p>
    <p>The nephew helped him willingly. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; finished Ryokan, &#8220;you see, a man becomes older and feebler day by day. Take good care of yourself.&#8221; Then Ryokan left, never mentioning a word about the courtesan or the complaints of the relatives. But, from that morning on, the dissipations of the nephew ended.</p>

    <h1>My Heart Burns Like Fire</h1>
    <p>Soyen Shaku, the first Zen teacher to come to America, said: &#8220;My heart burns like fire but my eyes are as cold as dead ashes.&#8221; He made the following rules, which he practiced every day of his life.</p>
    <p>In the morning before dressing, light incense and meditate.</p>
    <p>Retire at a regular hour. Partake of food at regular intervals. Eat with moderation and never to the point of satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Receive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. When alone, maintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests.</p>
    <p>Watch what you say, and whatever you say, practice it.</p>
    <p>When an opportunity comes do not let it pass by, yet always think twice before acting. Do not regret the past. Look to the future.</p>
    <p>Have the fearless attitude of a hero and the loving heart of a child.</p>
    <p>Upon retiring sleep as if you had entered your last sleep. Upon awakening, leave your bed behind you instantly as if you had cast away a pair of old shoes.</p>

    <h1>If You Love, Love Openly</h1>
    <p>Twenty monks and one nun, who was named Eshun, were practicing meditation with a certain Zen master.</p>
    <p>Eshun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her dress plain. Several monks secretly fell in love with her.</p>
    <p>One of them wrote her a love letter, insisting upon a private meeting.</p>
    <p>Eshun did not reply. The following day the master gave a lecture to the group, and when it was over, Eshun arose. Addressing the one who had written her, she said: &#8220;If you really love me so much, come and embrace me now.&#8221;</p>

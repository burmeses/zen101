    <h1>How to Write a Chinese Poem</h1>
    <p>A well-known Japanese poet was asked how to compose a Chinese poem. The usual Chinese poem is four lines,&#8221; he explained. The first line contains the initial phrase; the second line, the continuation of that phase; the third line turns from this subject and begins a new one; and the fourth line brings the first three lines together. A popular Japanese song illustrates this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Two daughters of a silk merchant live in Kyoto,<br />
      The elder is twenty, the younger, eighteen.<br />
      A soldier may kill with his sword,<br />
      But these girls slay men with their eyes.</p>

    <h1>Storyteller&#8217;s Zen</h1>
    <p>Encho was a famous storyteller. His tales of love stirred the hearts of his listeners. When he narrated a story of war, it was as if the listeners themselves were on the field of battle.</p>
    <p>One day Encho met Yamaoka Tesshu, a layman who had almost embraced master hood in Zen. &#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Yamaoka, &#8220;you are the best storyteller in our land and that you make people cry or laugh at will. Tell me my favorite story of the Peach Boy. When I was a little tot I used to sleep beside my mother, and she often related this legend. In the middle of the story I would fall asleep. Tell it to me just is my mother did.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Encho dared not attempt to do this. He requested time to study. Several months later he went to Yamaoka and said, &#8220;Please give me the opportunity to tell you the story.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Some other day,&#8221; answered Yamaoka.</p>
    <p>Encho was keenly disappointed. He studied further and tried again. Yamaoka rejected him many times. When Encho would start to talk Yamaoka would stop him, saying: &#8220;You are not yet like my mother.&#8221;</p>
    <p>It took Encho five years to be able to tell Yamaoka the legend as his mother had told it to him. In this way, Yamaoka imparted Zen to Encho.</p>

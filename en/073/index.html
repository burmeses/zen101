    <h1>Ten Successors</h1>
    <p>Zen pupils take a vow that even if they are killed by their teacher, they intend to learn Zen. Usually they cut a finger and</p>
    <p>seal their resolution with blood. In time the vow has become a men formality, and for this reason the pupil who died by the hand of Ekido was made to appear a martyr. Ekido had become a severe teacher. His pupils feared him. One of them on duty, striking the gong to tell the time of day, missed his beats when his eye was attracted by a beautiful girl passing the temple gate.</p>
    <p>At that moment Ekido, who was directly behind him, hit him with a stick and the shock happened to kill him.</p>
    <p>The pupil&#8217;s guardian, hearing of the accident went directly to Ekido. Knowing that he was not to blame he praised the master for his severe teaching. Ekido&#8217;s attitude was just the same as if the pupil were still alive.</p>
    <p>After this took place, he was able to produce under his guidance more than ten enlightened successors, a very unusual number.</p>

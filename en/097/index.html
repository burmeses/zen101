    <h1>Teaching the Ultimate</h1>
    <p>In early times in Japan, bamboo-and-paper lanterns wee used with candles inside. A blind man, visiting a friend one night was offered a lantern to carry home with him.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I do not need a lantern,&#8221; he said. Darkness or light is all the same to me&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I know you do not need a lantern to find your way,&#8221; his friend replied, &#8220;but if you don"t have one someone else may run into you. So you must take it.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The blind man started off with the lantern and before he had walked very far someone ran squarely into him. &#8220;Look out where you are going!&#8221; he exclaimed to the stranger. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see this lantern?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Your candle has burned out brother,&#8221; replied the stranger.</p>

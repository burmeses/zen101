    <h1>A Cup of Tea</h1>
    <p>Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.</p>
    <p>Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor&#8217;s cup full, and then kept on pouring.</p>
    <p>The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. &#8220;It is overfull. No more will go in!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Like this cup,&#8221; Nan-in said, &#8220;You are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?&#8221;</p>

    <h1>Flower Shower</h1>

<p>Subhuti was Buddha&#8217;s disciple. He was able to understand the potency of emptiness, the viewpoint that nothing exists except in its relationship of subjectivity and objectivity.</p>

<p>One day Subhuti, in a mood of sublime emptiness was sitting under a tree. Flowers began to fall about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness,&#8221; the gods whispered to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have not spoken of emptiness,&#8221; said Subhuti.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,&#8217; responded the gods. &#8216;This is the true emptiness.&#8217; And blossoms showered upon Subhuti as rain.</p>

    <h1>The Living Buddha and the Tubmaker</h1>
    <p>Zen masters give personal guidance in a secluded room. No one enters while teacher and pupil are together.</p>
    <p>Mokurai, the Zen master of Kennin temple in Kyoto, used to enjoy talking with merchants and newspapermen as well as with his pupils. A certain tubmaker was almost illiterate. He would ask foolish questions of Mokurai have tea, and then go away.</p>
    <p>One day while the tubmaker was there Mokurai wished to give personal guidance to a disciple so he asked the tubmaker to wait in another room.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I understand you are a living Buddha,&#8221; the man protested. &#8220;Even the stone Buddha&#8217;s in the temple never refuse the numerous persons who come together before them. Why then should I be excluded?&#8221;</p>
    <p>Mokurai had to go outside to see his disciple.</p>

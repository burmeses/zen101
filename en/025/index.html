    <h1>Three Days More</h1>
    <p>Suiwo, the disciple of Hakuin, was a good teacher. During one summer seclusion period, a pupil came to him from a southern island of Japan.</p>
    <p>Suiwo gave him the problem: &#8220;Hear the sound of one hand.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The pupil remained three years but could not pass this test. One night he came in tears to Suiwo. &#8220;I must return south in shame and embarrassment,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for I cannot solve my problem.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Wait one week more and meditate constantly,&#8221; advised Suiwo. Still no enlightenment came to the pupil. Try for another week,&#8221; said Suiwo. The pupil obeyed, but in vain.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Still another week.&#8221; Yet this was of no avail. In despair the student begged to be released, but Suiwo requested another meditation of five day. They were without result. Then he said: &#8220;Mediate for three days longer, then if you fail to attain enlightenment, you had better kill yourself.&#8221;</p>
    <p>On the second day the pupil was enlightened.</p>

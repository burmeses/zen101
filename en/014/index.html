    <h1>Muddy Road</h1>
    <p>Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling. Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection. &#8220;Come on, girl,&#8221; said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her over the mud.</p>
    <p>Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself. &#8220;We monks don&#8217;t go near females.&#8221; He told Tanzan, especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I left the girl there,&#8221; said Tanzan. &#8220;Are you still carrying her?&#8221;</p>

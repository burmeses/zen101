    <h1>Stingy in Teaching</h1>
    <p>A young physician in Tokyo named Kusuda met a college friend who had been studying Zen. The young doctor asked him what Zen was.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I cannot tell you what it is,&#8221; the friend replied, &#8220;but one thing is certain. If you understand Zen, you will not be afraid to die.&#8221;</p>
    <p>That&#8217;s fine: said Kusuda. â€œI will try it. Where can I find a teacher?&#8221; &#8220;Go to the master Nan-in,&#8221; the friend told him.</p>
    <p>So Kusuda went to call on Nan-in. He carried a dagger nine and a half inches long to determine whether or not the teacher himself was afraid to die.</p>
    <p>When Nan-in saw Kusuda he exclaimed: &#8220;Hello, friend. How are you? We haven&#8217;t seen each other for a long time!&#8221;</p>
    <p>This perplexed Kusuda, who replied: &#8220;We have never met before.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; answered Nan-in. I mistook you for another physician who is receiving instruction here.&#8221;</p>
    <p>With such a beginning, Kusuda lost his chance to test the master, so reluctantly be asked if he might receive Zen instruction.</p>
    <p>Nan-in said: &#8220;Zen is not a difficult task. If you are a physician, treat your patients with kindness. That is Zen.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Kusuda visited Nan-in three times. Each time Nan-in told him the same thing.&#8221; A physician should not waste time around here. Go home and take care of your patients.&#8221;</p>
    <p>It was not yet clear to Kusuda how such teaching could remove the fear of death. So on his fourth visit he complained: &#8220;My friend told me when one learns Zen one loses his fear of death. Each time I come here all you tell me is to take care of my patients. I know that much. If that is your so-called Zen, I am not going to visit you any more.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Nan-in smiled and patted the doctor. &#8220;I have been too strict with you. Let me give you a koan.&#8221; He presented Kusuda with Joshu&#8217;s Mu to work over, which is the first mind-enlightening problem in the book called The Gateless Gate.</p>
    <p>Kusuda pondered this problem of Mu (No-thing) for two years. At length he thought he had reached certainty of mind. But his teacher commented: &#8220;You are not in yet.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Kusuda continued in concentration for another year and a half. His mind became placid. Problems dissolved. No-thing became the truth. He served his patients well and, without even knowing it, be was free from concern over life and death.</p>
    <p>Then when he visited Nan-in his old teacher just smiled.</p>

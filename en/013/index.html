    <h1>A Buddha</h1>
    <p>In Tokyo in the Meiji era there lived two prominent teachers of opposite characteristics. One, Unsho, an instructor in Shingon, kept Buddha&#8217;s precepts scrupulously. He never drank intoxicants, nor did he eat after eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>
    <p>The other teacher, Tanzan, a professor of philosophy at the Imperial University, never observed the precepts. When he felt like eating he ate, and when he felt like sleeping in the daytime he slept.</p>
    <p>One day Unsho visited Tanzan, who was drinking wine at the time, not even a drop of which is supposed to touch the tongue of a Buddhist.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Hello, brother,&#8221; Tanzan greeted him. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you have a drink?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I never drink!&#8221; exclaimed Unsho solemnly.</p>
    <p>&#8220;One who does not drink is not even human,&#8221; said Tanzan.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Do you mean to call me inhuman just because I do not indulge in intoxicating liquids!&#8221; exclaimed Unsho in anger. Then if I am not human, what am I?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;A Buddha.&#8221; answered Tanzan.</p>

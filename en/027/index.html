    <h1>The Voice of Happiness</h1>
    <p>After Bankei had passed away, a blind man who lived near the master&#8217;s temple told a friend: &#8220;Since I am blind, I cannot watch a person&#8217;s face, so I must judge his character by the sound of his voice. Ordinarily when I hear someone congratulate another upon his happiness or success, I also hear a secret tone of envy. When condolence is expressed for the misfortune of another. I hear pleasure and satisfaction as if the one condoling was really glad there was something left to gain in his own world.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;In all my experience however, Bankei&#8217;s voice was always sincere. Whenever he expressed happiness, I heard nothing but happiness, and whenever he expressed sorrow, sorrow was all I heard.&#8221;</p>

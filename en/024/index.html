    <h1>Reciting Sutras</h1>
    <p>A farmer requested a Tendai priest to recite sutras for his wife, who had died. After the recitation was over the farmer asked: &#8220;Do you think my wife will gain merit from this?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Not only your wife but all sentient beings will benefit from the recitation of sutras,&#8221; answered the priest.</p>
    <p>&#8220;If you say all sentient beings will benefit,&#8221; said the farmer, &#8220;my wife may be very weak and others will take advantage of her, getting the benefit she should have. So please recite sutras just for her.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The priest explained that it was the desire of a Buddhist to offer blessings and wish merit for every living being.</p>
    <p>That is a fine teaching,&#8221; concluded the farmer, &#8220;but please make one exception. I have a neighbor who is rough and mean to me. Just exclude him from all those sentient beings.&#8221;</p>

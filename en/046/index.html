    <h1>How Grass and Trees Become Enlightened</h1>
    <p>During the Kamkura period, Shinkan studied Tendai six years and then studied Zen seven years; then he went to China and contemplated Zen for thirteen years more.</p>
    <p>When he returned to Japan many desired to interview him and asked obscure questions. But when Shinkan received visitors, which was infrequently, he seldom answered their questions.</p>
    <p>One day a fifty-year-old student of enlightenment said to Shinkan: &#8220;I have studied the Tendai school of thought since I was a little boy, but one thing in it I cannot understand. Tendai claims that even the grass and trees will become enlightened. To me this seems very strange.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Of what use is it to discuss how grass and trees become enlightened?&#8221; asked Shinkan. &#8220;The question is how you yourself can become so. Did you ever consider that!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I never thought of it in that way,&#8221; marveled the old man. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Then go home and think it over,&#8221; finished Shinkan.</p>

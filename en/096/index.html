    <h1>A Drop of Water</h1>
    <p>A Zen master named Gisan asked a young student to bring him a pail of water to cool his bath.</p>
    <p>The student brought the water and, after cooling the bath, threw on to the ground the little that was left over.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You dunce!&#8221; the master scolded him. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you give the rest of the water to the plants? What right have you to waste even a drop of water in this temple?&#8221;</p>
    <p>The young student attained Zen in that instant. He changed his name to Tekisui, which means a drop of water.</p>

    <h1>The Taste of Banzo&#8217;s Sword</h1>
    <p>Matajuro Yagyu was the son of a famous swordsman. His father, believing that his son&#8217;s work was too mediocre to anticipate mastership, disowned him.</p>
    <p>So Matajuro went to Mount Fuhra and there found the famous swordsman Banzo. But Banzo confirmed the father&#8217;s judgment. &#8220;You wish to learn swordsmanship under my guidance?&#8221; asked Banzo. &#8220;You cannot fulfill the requirements.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;But if I work hard, how many years will it take me to be come a master?&#8221; persisted the youth. &#8220;The rest of your life,&#8221; replied Banzo.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I cannot wait that long,&#8221; explained Matajuro. &#8220;I am willing to pass through any hardship if only you will teach me. If I become your devoted servant, how long might it be?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Oh, maybe ten years,&#8221; Banzo relented.</p>
    <p>&#8220;My father is getting old, and soon I must take care of him,&#8221; continued Matajuro. &#8220;If I work far more intensively, how long would it take me!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Oh, maybe thirty years.&#8221; said Banzo.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221; asked Matajuro. &#8220;First you say ten and now thirty years. I will undergo any hardship to master this art in the shortest time!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Banzo, &#8220;in that case you will have to remain with me for seventy years. A man in such a hurry as you are to get results seldom learns quickly.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; declared the youth, understanding at last that he was being rebuked for impatience, &#8220;I agree.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Matajuro was told never to speak of fencing and never to touch a sword. He cooked for his master, washed the dishes, made his bed, and cleaned the yard, cared for the garden, all without a word of swordsmanship.</p>
    <p>Three years passed. Still Matajuro labored on. Thinking of his future he was sad. He had not even begun to learn the art to which he had devoted his life.</p>
    <p>But one day Banzo crept up behind him and gave him a terrific blow with a wooden sword.</p>
    <p>The following day, when Matajuro was cooking rice, Banzo, again sprang upon him unexpectedly.</p>
    <p>After that, day and night, Matajuro had to defend himself from unexpected thrusts. Not a moment passed in any day that he did not have to think of the taste of Banzo&#8217;s sword.</p>
    <p>He learned so rapidly he brought smiles to the face of his master. Matajuro became the greatest swordsman in the land.</p>

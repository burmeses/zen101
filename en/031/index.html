    <h1>Everything is Best</h1>
    <p>When Banzan was walking through a market he overheard a conversation between a butcher and his customer. &#8220;Give me the best piece of meat you have,&#8221; said the customer.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Everything in my shop is the best,&#8221; replied me butcher. &#8220;You cannot find here any piece of meat that is not the best.&#8221; At these words Banzan became enlightened.</p>

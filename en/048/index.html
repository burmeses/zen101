    <h1>Accurate Proportion</h1>
    <p>Sen no Rikyu, a tea-master, wished to hang a flower basket on a column. He asked a carpenter to help him, directing the man to place it a little higher or lower, to the right or left, until he had found exactly the right spot. </p>
    <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place,&#8221; said Sen no Rikyu finally.</p>
    <p>The carpenter, to test the master, marked the spot and then pretended he had forgotten. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Was this the place? Was this the place, perhaps?&#8221; the carpenter kept asking, pointing to various places on the column.</p>
    <p>But so accurate was the tea-masters sense of proportion that it was not until the carpenter reached the identical spot again that its location was approved.</p>

    <h1>The Moon cannot be Stolen</h1>
    <p>Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing in it to steal.</p>
    <p>Ryokan returned and caught him. &#8220;You may have come a long way to visit me,&#8221; he told the prowler, &#8220;and you should not return empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.</p>
    <p>Ryokan sat naked, watching the moon. &#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;I wish I could give him this beautiful moon.&#8221;</p>

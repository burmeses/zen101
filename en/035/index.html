    <h1>Every-Minute Zen</h1>
    <p>Zen students are with their masters at last ten years before they presume to teach others. Nan-in was visited by Tenno, who, having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher. The day happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and carried an umbrella. After greeting him Nan-in remarked: &#8220;I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule. I want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of the clogs.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Tenno, confused, had no instant answer. He realized that he was unable to carry his Zen every minute. He became Nan- in&#8217;s pupil, and he studied six more years to accomplish his every-minute Zen.</p>

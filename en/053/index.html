    <h1>The Giver Should be Thankful</h1>
    <p>While Seisetsu was the master of Engaku in Kamakura he required larger quarters, since those in which he was teaching were overcrowded. Umezu Seibei, a merchant of Edo, decided to donate five hundred pieces of gold called ryo toward the construction of a more commodious school. This money he brought to the teacher.</p>
    <p>Seisetsu said: &#8220;All right. I will take it.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Umezu gave Seisetsu the sack of gold, but he was dissatisfied with the attitude of the teacher. One might live a whole year on three ryo, and the merchant had not even been thanked for five hundred.</p>
    <p>&#8220;In that sack are five hundred ryo,&#8221; hinted Umezu. </p>
    <p>&#8220;You told me that before,&#8221; replied Seisetsu.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Even if I am a wealthy merchant, five hundred ryo is a lot of money,&#8221; said Umezu. </p>
    <p>&#8220;Do you want me to thank you for it?&#8221; asked Seisetsu.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You ought to,&#8221; replied Umezu.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; inquired Seisetsu. &#8220;The giver should be thankful.&#8221;</p>

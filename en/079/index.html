    <h1>Incense Burner</h1>
    <p>A woman of Nagasaki named Kame was one of the few makers of incense burners in Japan. Such a burner is a work of art to be used only in a tea room or before a family shrine.</p>
    <p>Kame whose father before her had been such an artist, was fond of drinking. She also smoked and associated with men most of the time. Whatever she made a little money she gave a feast inviting artists, poets, carpenters, workers, men of many vocations and avocations. In their association she evolved her designs.</p>
    <p>Kame was exceedingly slow in creating, but when her work was finished it was always a masterpiece. Her burners were treasured in homes whose womenfolk never drank, smoked, or associated freely with men.</p>
    <p>The mayor of Nagasaki once requested Kame to design an incense burner for him. She delayed doing so until almost half a year had passed. At that time the mayor, who had been promoted to office in a distant city, visited her. He urged Kame to begin work on his burner.</p>
    <p>At last receiving the inspiration, Kame made the incense burner. After it was completed she placed it upon a table. She looked at it long and carefully. She smoked and drank before it as if it were her own company. All day she observed it.</p>
    <p>At last, picking up a hammer, Kame smashed it to bits. She saw it was not the perfect creation her mind demanded.</p>

    <h1>Soldiers of Humanity</h1>
    <p>Once a division of the Japanese army was engaged in I sham battle, and some of the officers found it necessary to make their headquarters in Gasan&#8217;s temple.</p>
    <p>Gasan told his cook: &#8220;Let the officers have only the same simple fare we eat.&#8221;</p>
    <p>This made the army men angry, as they were used to very differential treatment. One came to Gasan and said: &#8220;Who do you think we are? We are soldiers, sacrificing our lives for our country. Why don&#8217;t you treat us accordingly?&#8221;</p>
    <p>Gasan answered sternly: &#8220;Who do you think we are? We are soldiers of humanity aiming to save all sentient beings.&#8221;</p>

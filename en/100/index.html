    <h1>The Silent Temple</h1>
    <p>Shoichi was a one-eyed teacher of Zen, sparkling with enlightenment. He taught his disciple in Tofuku temple.</p>
    <p>Day and night the whole temple stood in silence. There was no sound at all.</p>
    <p>Even the reciting of sutras was abolished by the teacher. His pupils had nothing to do but meditate.</p>
    <p>When the master passed away, an old neighbor heard the ringing of bells and the recitation of sutras. Then she knew Shoichi had gone.</p>

    <h1>No Loving-Kindness</h1>
    <p>There was an old woman in China who had supported a monk for over twenty years. She had built a little hut for him and fed him while he was meditating. Finally she wondered just what progress he had made in all this time.</p>
    <p>To find out, she obtained the help of a girl rich in desire. &#8220;Go and embrace him,&#8221; she told her;&#8221; and then ask him suddenly: &#8220;What now?&#8221;</p>
    <p>The girl called upon the monk and without much ado caressed him, asking him what he was going to do about it. &#8220;An old tree grows on a cold rock in winter,&#8221; replied the monk somewhat poetically. &#8220;Nowhere is there any warmth.&#8221; The girl returned and related what he had said.</p>
    <p>&#8220;To think I fed that fellow for twenty years!&#8221; exclaimed the old woman in anger. &#8220;He showed no consideration for your need, no disposition to explain your condition. He need not have responded to passion, but at last he should have evidenced some compassion.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She at once went to the hut of the monk and burned it down.</p>

    <h1>Happy Chinaman</h1>
    <p>Anyone walking about Chinatowns in America will observe statues of a stout fellow carrying a linen sack. Chinese merchants call him Happy Chinaman or Laughing Buddha.</p>
    <p>This Hotei lived in the T"ang dynasty. He had no desire to call himself a Zen master or to gather many disciples about him. Instead he walked the streets with a big sack into which he would put gifts of candy, fruit, or doughnuts. These he would give to children who gathered around him in play. He established a kindergarten of the streets.</p>
    <p>Whenever he met a Zen devotee he would extend his hand and say: &#8220;Give me one penny.&#8221; And if anyone asked him to return to a temple to teach others, again he would reply: &#8220;Give me one penny.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Once as he was about his play work another Zen master happened along and inquired: &#8220;What is the significance of Zen?&#8221; Hotei immediately plopped his sack down on the ground in silent answer.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; asked the other, &#8220;what is the actualization of Zen?&#8221;</p>
    <p>At once the Happy Chinaman swung the sack over his shoulder and continued on his way.</p>

    <h1>Just Go to Sleep</h1>
    <p>Gasan was sitting at the bedside of Tekisui three days before his teacher&#8217;s passing. Tekisui had already chosen him as his successor.</p>
    <p>A temple recently had burned and Gasan was busy rebuilding the structure. Tekisui asked him: &#8220;What are you going to do when you get the temple rebuilt?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;When your sickness is over we want you to speak there,&#8221; said Gasan. &#8220;Suppose I do not live until then?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Then we will get someone else,&#8221; replied Gasan.</p>
    <p>Suppose you cannot find anyone?&#8221; continued Tekisui.</p>
    <p>Gasan answered loudly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask such foolish questions. Just go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>Zen Dialogue</h1>
    <p>Zen teachers train their young pupils to express themselves. Two Zen temples; each had a child protégé. One child going to obtain vegetables each morning would meet the other on the way.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the one.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I am going wherever my feet go.&#8221; the other responded.</p>
    <p>This reply puzzled the first child who went to his teacher for help.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Tomorrow morning,&#8221; the teacher told him, &#8220;when you meet that little fellow, ask him the same question. He will give you the same answer, and then you ask him: &#8220;Suppose have no feet, then where are you going!&#8221; That will fix him.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The children met again the following morning. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the first child. &#8220;I am going wherever the wind blows,&#8221; answered the other.</p>
    <p>This again nonplussed the youngster, who took his defeat to his teacher.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Ask him where he is going if there is no wind,&#8221; suggested the teacher.</p>
    <p>The next day the children met a third time.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the first child.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I am going to market to buy vegetables,&#8221; the other replied.</p>

    <h1>The Blockhead Lord</h1>
    <p>Two Zen teachers Daigu and Gudo, were invited to visit a lord. Upon arriving, Gudo said to the lord: &#8220;You are wise by nature and have an inborn ability to learn Zen.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Daigu &#8220;Why do you flatter this blockheads? He may be a lord, but he doesn&#8217;t know anything of Zen.&#8221; So, instead of building a temple for Gudo the lord built it for Daigu and studied Zen with him.</p>

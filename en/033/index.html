    <h1>Mokusen&#8217;s Hand</h1>
    <p>Mokusen Hiki was living in a temple in the province of Tamba. One of his adherents complained of the stinginess of his wife. Mokusen visited the adherent&#8217;s wife and showed her his clenched fist before her face.</p>
    <p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked the surprised woman.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Suppose my fist were always like that. What would you call it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Deformed,&#8221; replied the woman.</p>
    <p>Then he opened his hand flat in her face and asked: &#8220;Suppose it were always like that. What then?&#8221; &#8220;Another kind of deformity,&#8221; said the wife.</p>
    <p>&#8220;If you understand that much,&#8221; finished Mokusen, &#8220;you are a good wife.&#8221; Then he left.</p>
    <p>After his visit, this wife helped her husband to distribute as well as to save.</p>

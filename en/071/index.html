    <h1>Learning to be Silent</h1>
    <p>The pupils of the Tendai School used to study meditation before Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised one another to observe seven days of silence.</p>
    <p>On the first day all were silent Their meditation had begun auspiciously, but when night came and the oil-lamps were growing dim one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: &#8220;Fix those lamps.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. &#8220;We are not supposed to say a word,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You two are stupid. Why did you talk?&#8221; asked the third.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I am the only one who has not talked,&#8221; muttered the fourth pupil.</p>

    <h1>No Work, No Food</h1>
    <p>Hyakujo, the Chinese Zen master, used to labor with his pupils even at the age of eighty, trimming the gardens, cleaning the grounds, and pruning the trees.</p>
    <p>The pupils felt sorry to see the old teacher working so hard, but they knew he would not listen to their advice to stop, so they hid away his tools.</p>
    <p>That day the master did not eat. The next day he did not eat, nor the next. &#8220;He may be angry because we have hidden his tools,&#8221; the pupils surmised. &#8220;We had better put than back.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The day they did, the teacher worked and ate the same as before. In the evening he instructed them: &#8220;No work, no food.&#8221;</p>

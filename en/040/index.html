    <h1>In Dreamland</h1>
    <p>&#8220;Our schoolmaster used to take a nap every afternoon,&#8221; related a disciple of Soyen Shaku. &#8220;We children asked him why he did it and he told us: &#8220;I go to dreamland to meet the old sages just as Confucius did.&#8221; When Confucius slept, he would dream of ancient sages and later tell his followers about them.</p>
    <p>&#8220;It was extremely hot one day so some of us took a nap. Our schoolmaster scolded us. &#8220;We went to dreamland to meet the ancient sages the same as Confucius did,&#8221; we explained. &#8220;What was the message from those sages?&#8221; our schoolmaster demanded. One of us replied: &#8220;We went to dreamland and met the sages and asked than if our schoolmaster came there every afternoon, but they said they had never seen any such fellow.&#8221;</p>
